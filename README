OpenPSS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

OpenPSS is an algorithm for prostate segmentation in TRUS images.

This software contains the spams (http://spams-devel.gforge.inria.fr/) and
graphcut_optimize (http://vision.csd.uwo.ca/code/) packages, which require 
a C++ compiler to build the packages first before you can make this
software work.
Please find the README files therein for more information.

The implementation of several trivial steps of the framework is not 
provided in this publicly available version, and only the *.mat files 
are available.

One pre-aligned shape groups are provided in this distribution, which 
can be used to train the shape model (you might need to modify the dataName
in the cell for different datasets).

Usage: add the whole software directory to the Matlab PATH, then open the 
openPSS.m file and follow the instructions therein.
